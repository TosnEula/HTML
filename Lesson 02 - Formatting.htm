<h1>Paragraphs</h1>

<p>Simplying typing a paragraph normally and using the start-end elements create a paragraph.</p>
<p>Starting another paragraph is as simple as starting yet another <i>p</i> element.</p>

<h1>Helpful Functions</h1>
<p>Using the element <i>b</i> creates a <b> BOLD </b> marker.        <br>Similarly the element <i>i</i> creates an <i> itlaized</i> marker.</p>

<p>sub and sup markers make subscripts and superscripts respectively. e=mc<sup>2</sup> or CO<sub>2</sub></p>


<p>   <br />hr / creates a horizontal line as such. </p>
<hr />

<h1>Semantic Markups</h1>
<p>Semantic markups are elements that are not intended to affect the structure of the web page but add extra information.</p>

<p> <i>em</i> and <i>strong</i> appears as italics and bold respectively. Strong will show that the item has strong importance while em shows that theres a subtly difference.
<p><strong>BEWARE</strong>: pickpockets operate in this area.</p>

<h2>Quotations</h2>
<p> There are two kinds of quotes, the element <i>blockquote</i> and <i>q</i></p>
<p> The blockquote is used for an entire paragraph and indents the sentences, while the quote is used for a sentence.</p>


<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Winnie-the-Pooh">
<p>Did you ever stop to think, and forget to start
again?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As A.A. Milne said, <q>Some people talk to
animals. Not many listen though. That's the
problem.</q></p>

<h2> Writing elements</h2>
<p> <i>abbr</i> is the element used to show abbreviations for acornyms and titles. an attribute is used to display the definition.</p>

Administration">NASA</acronym> do some crazy
space stuff.</p>

Hawking has sold over ten million copies
worldwide.</p>
